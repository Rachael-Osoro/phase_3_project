Vaccines reduce risks of getting a disease by working with your body’s natural defences (immunity) to build protection. Vaccines are also critical in the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks such as  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"> Influenza</a>, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19"> COVID-19</a>, etc. In addition, vaccines can provide enough immunization in a community further reducing spread of diseases through “herd immunity”. Eventually leading to disease eradication/ elimination for instance Small Pox. 

One of the commonest infection worldwide is the influenza virus aka ‘flu’ which attacks the human respiratory tract, causing symptoms such as fever, headaches, fatigue, coughing, sore throat, nasal congestion, and body aches. It is a seasonal diasease with high incidence in the colder months. According to <a href = "https://www.wiscontext.org/understanding-perennial-menace-influenza-virus"> this report by Samantha Nash </a>, about 8.3% of USA population get influenza annually. During the 2017-18 flu season, the use of the influenza vaccine is estimated to have prevented 5,700 deaths and 91,000 hospitalizations in the U.S. 
A variant of the influenza virus, H1N1, famously known as swine flu caused a pandemic that led to 61 million clinical cases of influenza, 274,000 hospitalizations and 12,500 deaths. A vaccine for the H1N1 flu virus became publicly available in October 2009 which prevented 700,000–1,500,000 clinical cases, 4,000–10,000 hospitalizations, and 200–500 deaths. <a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3647645/">according to this study </a>.

## Project Goal
Immunization is a global health and development success story, saving lives every year. Vaccines reduce disease spread, therefore, maximizing immunization coverage for any population is a crucial public health goal for all countries.
The aim of this project is to predict the vaccination status of person based on their response to survey questions. The results will be utilized by public health departments to ramp up campaigns, mass vaccination, conduct health education on those assigned unvaccinated in order to promote vaccination against influenza.

## Data & Methods
Each row in the dataset represents one person who responded to the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey and there are two target variables. Data is valid, obtained from
