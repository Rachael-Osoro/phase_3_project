Vaccines reduce risks of getting a disease by working with your body’s natural defences (immunity) to build protection. Vaccines are also critical in the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks such as  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"> Influenza</a>, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19"> COVID-19</a>, etc. In addition, vaccines can provide enough immunization in a community further reducing spread of diseases through “herd immunity”. Eventually leading to disease eradication/ elimination for instance Small Pox.
