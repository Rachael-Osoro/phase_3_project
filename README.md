Vaccines reduce risks of getting a disease by working with your body’s natural defences (immunity) to build protection. Vaccines are also critical in the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks such as  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"> Influenza</a>, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19"> COVID-19</a>, etc. In addition, vaccines can provide enough immunization in a community further reducing spread of diseases through “herd immunity”. Eventually leading to disease eradication/ elimination for instance Small Pox. 

A variant of the influenza virus, H1N1, famously known as swine flu caused a pandemic that led to 61 million clinical cases of influenza, 274,000 hospitalizations and 12,500 deaths. A vaccine for the H1N1 flu virus became publicly available in October 2009 which prevented 700,000–1,500,000 clinical cases, 4,000–10,000 hospitalizations, and 200–500 deaths. <a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3647645/">according to this study </a>.
